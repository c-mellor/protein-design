## Rosetta relax
# Test run
Do a test run with 10 structures first to troubleshoot and iron out any errors before you throw 1000x runs
into the system; then when you do your array, everything should go nice and smoothly. This uses the single
slurm file.
1. You will need the following files: an .xml Rosetta scripts file which does the relaxing; a coordination.cst
file that sets up heme-protein bonding; a single_slurm.sh file for a small test run; flags (no file
ending) which tells Rosetta which script to use, how many structures to generate.
2. Make sure file names and atom names/numbers are all in agreement!! This is your number 1 source
of errors. . .
3. Once all your files are set up in a relax folder (also make an empty /output folder ), run sbatch
single_slurm.sh
4. It can take up to an hour for your test relax run; check the slurm.out file for errors as well as
the Rosetta crash file
# Production run
1. This is very similar to the test run; before starting the real deal, put your test run results in their
own folder so they don’t get mixed up with the proper array in the ’output’ directory
2. Edit the array_slurm_serial.sh file to include a relevant run name and your username. Also
change the flags file to nstruct 500, not 10
3. Then you can just run sbatch array_slurm_serial.sh. This will take longer, closer to 5 hours.
